# Click-Mints

My Alchemy University Ethereum Developers Bootcamp Final Project

Click Mints is an NFT Launchpad built on the Mumbai Network with Nextjs using Alchemy's [Create-web3-dapp](https://createweb3dapp.alchemy.com) as a starter template.

An NFT Launchpad is a platform that assists the minting and launch of NFT projects. With the NFT Launchpad development services, the creators can increase funds to develop, launch, and market their NFT projects. These are very similar to IDO Launchpads but cater specially to NFT creators.

Create-web3-dapp is an npx tool that allows developers to create web3 applications in ~4 minutes. It allows web3 developers to build production-ready decentralized applications at lightning speed, using pre-made React components, webhooks, and APIs.

Click Mints boasts an NFT mintpad for minting NFTs for different project teams, an NFT gallery that allows users to view the minted NFTs in their connected wallet, NFTs in a contract address (NFT Collection) and any wallet address with NFTs on the Ethereum mainnet and testnet(goerli), Polygon mainnet and testnet(Mumbai), Arbitrum or Optimism Network. It also boasts an NFT creation tool that allows users to upload an image, input their NFT name, description and attributes and mint their NFT on the Mumbai Network.

## Quick Start 

To get started:

1. Clone the project repository

After that change directory (cd) into the frontend folder and run `npm install` to download all the project dependencies

Also change directory (cd) into the backend folder in a different terminal and run `npm install` to download all the project dependencies

2. Create a unique Alchemy API key 

If you have not already done so, create a unique Alchemy API Mumbai key
for your project as [described here](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/api-overview?a=eth-bootcamp).

3. Create your WalletConnect ProjectID 

If you don't already have one, create an account [here](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in) and get one.

4. Get you Pinata JWT

you can create an account on pinata website as[described here](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/nft-creator-component)if you don't already have one 

5. setup your .env files in frontend root folder and then run `npm run dev` in your terminal to start the development server and explore the app.

## Further Development

Plans are in motion to:

1. Add more active test NFT projects on the Mintpad page.

2. Add functionality for minting a collection (multiple image files) on the NFT creation page.

## Mentions

This project would not have been possible without all the knowledge gotten from Alchemy University's seven (7) weeks [Ethereum Developers Bootcamp](https://university.alchemy.com),  and further learning on [BlockTrain](https://www.blocktrain.info) and [StackUp](https://app.stackup.dev), to name a notable few.
